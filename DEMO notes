Directories
    Linux uses a tree structure to organize directories
    directories generally house specific types of files
    users have their own directory under the /usr or /home directory
    directories act just like any other file EXCEPT that they can contain files
    . refers to the current directory while .. refers to the parent directory

Files
    all files have certain permissions. when you use the [ls -l] command, you will see      
        something like drwxr-sr-x before each file. this shows the permissions currently set on           
        that file.
    case matters when naming files
    there are several ways to create a new file

Useful commands (note that most commands have OPTIONS or SWITCHES that effect their behavior)
    man show the manpage for a command
    pwd shows current directory
    cd changes directory
    ls lists files in a directory
    mv moves or renames a file
